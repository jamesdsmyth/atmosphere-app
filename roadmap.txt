--- structure ---

entry point is App.js
  from here we provide it (wrap it) with the store. Within this is the <Wrapper />

  <Wrapper /> is passed the state using redux.
    here we have if statements to show the correct screen depending on where the API request is.

    the possible screens here are 
      <ClimateScreen />
      <ErrorScreen />
      <FetchingScreen />

      depending on what the response is the from API call (using axios), we display the correct screen
