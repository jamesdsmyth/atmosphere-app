--- Roadmap ---

Prompt asks if the current color is suitable.
 - clicking yes dispatches an action to firebase.
 - clicking no displays 2 colors side by side.
  - the top color is the old color and the bottom color is a new color from firebase.
  - to approach this I need to first create the click events and css to view different colors.

  Saga testing
  Set up a load of click events that dispatch actions where we can test sagas
  Firebase needs to be added here
